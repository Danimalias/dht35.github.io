                            <p>To prepare for this lab I first downloaded the most recent version of the Arduino IDE and downloaded the Sparkfun Apollo3 board. Then I connected to the Artemis board making sure to select the correct COM port.</p>

                            <p>The first task was to follow the example code given to make the onboard LED blink. Below is a video.</p>

                            <p>The second task was to run the Serial program on the Artemis board to get familiar with serial monitor. We tested UART communication between the board and the computer. </p>

                            <p>The third task was to test the onboard temperature sensor using the analogRead() function using an example code. As I put my finger nearer to the sensor, the temperature sensor output on the Serial monitor rose.</p>

                            <p>The fourth task was to test out the microphone on the board. I used a video that had different frequencies and saw how the microphone picked up the different frequencies using the Serial monitor.</p>

                            <p>The last task was to make a program that would light up the onboard LED whenever a C note was played. In order to
                                achieve this I combined the blink and the microphone examples together and edited the main loop function so that
                                it would blink the LED. I edited the printLoudest() function on the given example microphone code and in the main loop, added an if
                                statement that would light up the LED whenever it detected a frequency range between 260 and 265 Hz since that range 
                                corresponded to a C note. Below is a video where I tested it with and without a C note playing.

                            <p>The setup for this lab involved creating a virtual Python environment with all the required 
                                packages for the course, along with the codebase needed for the lab tasks. After that, 
                                I configured Jupyter Lab to run the lab code and updated the necessary settings in the 
                                connection.yaml file, such as the MAC address and UUID, to enable my Artemis board to 
                                connect to my laptop. To ensure that only my laptop could pair with my board, I generated 
                                a random UUID in Python. Finally, I established a Bluetooth connection between my laptop 
                                and the board.
