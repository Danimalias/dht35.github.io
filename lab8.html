                            <p>For this lab, I decided on making my car do a flip on open loop control. I was going to attempt to do this with closed loop but unfortunately my computer screen broke and 
                                I lost my motivation. Shout out to Lulu for letting me borrow her monitor and room to do this lab. To do this lab, I made a new command called STUNT that would actually do the flip.
                                This command also sent the pwm speed and the distance 
                                data over via bluetooth. To do the flip, I had the car go straight very fast then go in the opposite direction when it was one feet away from the wall. To make the flip easier, I put a few rocks at the bottom of the 
                                car in the battery compartment. Below are screenshots of my code to do the flip in open loop. 
                            </p>

                            alt="Lab 4 Hardware" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"/>
                           
                            
                            <p>
                                After a few tries with fixing my speed and fiddling with the weights on my car, I was able to get the car to flip and run back. At first I put too many pebbles and noticed it significantly weighed the car down and made it much slower.
                                This made the car not able to flip. I also had taped all 4 wheels of the car but I soon realized that this was what was stopping me from being able to flip so I removed the tape from the two front
                                wheels of the car. Once I did that I was able to get the car to flip reliably on the carpet floor. Below is a video of the stunt and a graph of the pwm value of the car and the distance 
                                sensed by my TOF sensor over time the first time I was able to get the car to flip. This trial in particular was the fastest with the car going 2.7 seconds to go forward flip and go back to the starting line.

                            <p> After getting it working the first time I did a few more trials to see if the car could reliably flip. Below are videos and graphs of it working for the second and third time. </p>
